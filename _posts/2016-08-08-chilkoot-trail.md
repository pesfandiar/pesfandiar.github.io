Chilkoot Trail, a 53-km trail from Dyea, Alaska to Bennett, BC, was the main way for gold rush prospectors in late 1890s to get to Klondike River in Yukon. This slideshow contains photos of my 5-day hike through this historic trail.

            "Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!" An old newspaper from Seattle shows how the gold rush started. When a large shipping of gold from Yukon arrived in the US, media started creating hype, and people desperate from the economic downturn swarmed towards Yukon to get a piece of that pie. Little did they know how brutal the winter conditions are, and how little gold they can claim after the news was already out.

            Gold rush prospectors had to carry a huge amount of luggage with them. After arriving in Alaska, they had to take Chilkoot trail, and after reaching Bennett Lake, they could use Yukon River for rafting up to Dawson City (gold fields). Pictured is the 45-degree-sloped Chilkoot Pass which was the most difficult part of the trail. The Canadian police was stationed at the top of the pass.
