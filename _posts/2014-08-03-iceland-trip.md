Last month, I had a 11-day trip to Iceland, and spent most of it taking a road trip around the country. A few unprocessed pictures taken by my phone don't quite capture how amazing my experience was. This slideshow is my attempt at sharing some of it nevertheless.

            Strokkur, Geysir's little sister that squirts boiling water up to 20-30 meters every few minutes. Tourists are solemnly awaiting the next squirt, while the gusting wind makes a creepy noise.

            The wind on the Southern side of Iceland was exceptionally fast, as you can see. It was categorized as class 7, where class 10 is a full-blown hurricane.
