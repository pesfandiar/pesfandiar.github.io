After hosting a single-page site/resume on [Nearly Free Speech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net) for a while, I decided to shop around for a more reliable host so I can start blogging. I don't have a plan to write often, but this will be a platform to share ideas once in a while.

After looking around, [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) seemed to be one of the best options out there for a couple of reasons:
* It is free
* You can use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) natively

The only catch is it's only free if you use a public Github repository, and if you are a secretive type that may change your notes often or hide them, one can easily go through your commit history and find about your juicy secrets! Now I couldn't care less about that aspect, so what you see here is currently hosted on a public repository.

As for Jekyll's boilerplate and themes, I find [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) to be very helpful to set up a Jekyll site. I had to massage it a little bit, and add a paginated blog page, but it was straightforward overall. Of course, you can have a look at the source code [here](https://github.com/pesfandiar/pesfandiar.github.io).

Suggestions are welcome. Please feel free to email them, until I decide whether or not it's a good idea to use third-party commenting engines (e.g. [Disqus](http://disqus.com)).
