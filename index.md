I am a father and a software engineering expert, living in beautiful Metro Vancouver.

I have experience and interest in different areas including machine learning, analytics, technical leadership and software development from low-level C/C++ programming to full-stack web hacking to cloud architecture.

My hobbies include working out, hiking, and self studying different subjects.

I occasionally write blog posts [here](/blog).
