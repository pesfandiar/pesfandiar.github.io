I live and work in Vancouver, BC as a software development engineer.

I have experience and interest in different areas including but not limited to data mining and machine learning, software development from low level C/C++ programming to front-end Javascript hacking, business intelligence, and data analysis.

My hobbies include working out, hiking, and self studying different subjects such as finance, operations management, entrepreneurial business administration, etc.

If you live or work near Downtown Vancouver and any of those subjects interests you, I'd like to meet you over a cup of coffee or during the lunch break.
