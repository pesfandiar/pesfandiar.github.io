I am a father and a software engineer, living in beautiful Vancouver, BC.

I have experience and interest in different areas including but not limited to data mining and machine learning, data analysis, and software development from low-level C/C++ programming to front-end hacking to cloud architecture.

My hobbies include working out, hiking, and self studying different subjects such as finance, operations management, entrepreneurial business administration, etc.

If you live or work near Downtown Vancouver and any of those subjects interests you, I'd like to meet you over a cup of coffee or during the lunch break.
